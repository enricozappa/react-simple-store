# react-simple-store

A simple demo store created in React 18 for educational purposes, especially to learn hierarchy between components and routing, using:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - A library for web and native user interfaces
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) - a Google hosting service used to host this project
- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) - a NoSQL database used to store and fetch products
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast frontend build tool
- [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) - A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally
- [Stripe API] - A set of tools for building and integrating online payment systems

This project was developed following this [React tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/) tutorial, making also some changes and personalizations.
